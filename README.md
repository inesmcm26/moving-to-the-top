# moving-to-the-top

The goal of this statistical project is to answer the question 'Are easy-to-dance songs more popular?' using OLS to fit a linear regression to the data.
<br>

The data used include cross-sectional information about the top 100 songs from Spotify across the years 2010-2019. The relevant variables to answer the research question were firstly selected, followed by the specification of the model and, finally, the interpretatin of the results.
